# ModernArtUI
The final project for Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1 from Coursera. 
The course can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/course/androidpart1

The goal of the project was to implement rectangles of different colors following the parameters:
- At least one grey/white shaded rectangle
- At least one colored rectangle

And then to utilize a seekbar to change the colors of the rectangles excluding the white/grey shaded rectangles.

The project pulls its inspiration from Modernism in Art and I utilize art from http://www.moma.org as a conduit of that inspiration.
A option from the menu calls a dialog that will open a browser to bring the user to MOMA.
